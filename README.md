# Discord Bot Examples

This repository provides the source code used throughout the Discord bot tutorial series of [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain). Each folder corresponds to the final code showcased in that episode of the tutorial series together with an explanation of what changes and additions were made during that episode.

Each episode builds ontop of the previous one. So if you've got questions on why some things are done the way they are in existing code, have a look at previous episodes!
